# Bacterial-Data-with-Plotly

This project creates an engaging and dynamic dashboard to share the lab results of the top ten bacterial species that colonize in human bellybutton to create a Improbable Beef. 

Using JavaScript and Plotlyto create and design a dashboard to show multiple visualization of the dataset and some insighs.

The belly button data exists in JSON format (samples.json). In order to be able to visualize it with Plotly, we read the data into script file. Then use the D3.js library to do this. While D3 is primarily a data visualization library, its d3.json() method will allow us to read external JSON files, as well as place calls to external web APIs for data.
Here is a link to the dashboard:
